# miniRT
This school project is a `ray tracing` rendering program (using school library `42 MLX`.)

## Features
* This project is written in `C` (based on school requirement).
* Based on scene input _(image size, object/camera position and etc., see [here](#scene-input-file))_, this program will open a window and render the image.
* Keyboard and mouse interactivity are implemented to change viewer perspective.
* Following basic shapes are implemented:<br />
    `Plane` | `Sphere` | `Cylinder` | `Square` | `Triangle` | `Cube` | `Pyramid` | `Cone`
* Following effects are implemented:<br />
  * Light:
    * Colord and multiple spotlight
    * Ambient lightning
    * Parrele light following a precise direction
  * Color effect:
    * Normal disruption (wave effect)
    * Checkerboard pattern
    * Rainbow effect
    * Sphere texture: uv mapping
    * Bump map texture
  * Color filter

## Usage
This program will render image in a window from a valid scene input file. The rendered window is interactive with keyboard/mouse.

### Run the program
`./run.sh [SCENE_INPUT_FILE]`<br />
`SCENE_INPUT_FILE = "*.rt"`<br />

* File extension has to be `.rt`.
* Input data has to meet the [requirements](#scene-input-file).
* Pre-existing scene files can be found under directory `scene` _(no need to add `./scene/` for these files when passing as an argument)_.

### Window Interactivity
It is possible to change the viewer perspective in the scene through keyboard and mouse:
* Move viewer perspective from keyboard:
  * up: ⬆️ or `w`
  * down: ⬇️ or `s`
  * left: ⬅️ or `a`
  * right: ➡️ or `d`
  * forward: `e`
  * backward: `q`
* Move viewer perspective from mouse click:
  * `one left click` on any position inside the window
* Switch camera _(if multiple camera positions are provided in the input file)_:
  * keyboard `c` 
* Close window:
  * Mouse click on ❌ at the window corner
  * Keyboard `esc`

### Scene Input File
* It will contain the window/rendered image size, which implies your miniRT
must be able to render in any positive size.
* Each type of element can be separated by one or more line break(s).
* Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more
space(s).
* Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
* Elements which are defined by a capital letter can only be declared once in
the scene.
* Each element first’s information is the type identifier (composed by one or two
character(s)), followed by all specific information for each object in a strict
order such as:
