>> Current update:
(done) - correct exit with segmentation fault 
(done) - --save must exit
(done) - display if one H/W exceed, just change to computer display resolution
(done) - go through evaluation sheet one by one

2nd submission ready.

>> Next step:

>> HouseKeeping before submit
- delete all .o file
- take out execution file / .bmp file 
- restore Makefile for mlx.dylib
- delete file + all header of "other_check"
- double check on any 'printf'
- double check on segmentation fault

>> To note:
- in trace(), whenever involved light_direction, remember to check whether use unit_vector or not.
- figure out light intensity (1 / 4 * pi * distance to light square)

WORK JOURNAL
###########################################################################
02-25 (Thur)
- obj list
- improve scene struct (incl. mlx variables)
- camera switch/rotation/translation

02-26 (Fri)
- checkboard pattern
- improve struct on tr to save calculation in run-time (pre-store info)

03-01 (Mon)
- wave effect
- rainbow effect
- cone

03-02(Tue)
- fixed cylinder >> m_rotation function changed: 1) if degree is zero(old and new is the same, then return unit_matrix; 2) if degree is 180, then return reverse matrix; 3) otherwise, set the axis to unit_vector.
- improved camera-screen rotation (involve m_rotation function).

03-03(Wed)
- cube (with flexible normal)
- pyramid (with flexible normal)
- improved struct t_obj (put all pre-processed information into t_storage)

03-04(Thur)
- build checker pattern for all shape (incl. sp)
- improved obj stucture - add t_texture and checker (grid side) in storage 
- consolidated in the parsing section:
	- read_effect
	- process_obj
- defined obj_shape in header file to prevent future mis-update
- improved hit_any function. now calculate all hit related info at the end of the function (avoid unnecessary calculation if ray traced multiple objs)
- fixed cy/co inside intersection

03-05(Fri)
- fixed cb/pr (all) inside intersection
- corrected co hit->normal_out(previously used the same as cy which is not correct)

03-09 (Tue)
- change the process of light brightness to be applied directly in parsing section (calculated in light color)
- combined diffuse and specular color function (before seperate go through lights list, now all together)
- surface color function only need hit instead of pointer to hit, changed that.
- added directional light
- fixed cube normal (before convert phit to local, now use new_ray to calculate phit)
- added color filter
- added error checking for essention info on .rt file (Resolution/Ambient Light/Camera)

03-10 (Wed)
- study light & color for digital image 
- study bmp file

03-11 (Thur)
- create bmp.c successfully
- cancelled hook_loop
- mouse hook camera rotation done!

03-12 (Fri)
- bump map texture works!!!

03-13 (Sat)
- re-intall norminette (change PATH)
- review subject requirement
- review norminette for all files

03-15 (Mon)
- multi-thread done
- makefile incl. bonus rule
- improve camera rotation/translation (now it is relative to current camera)
- correct triangle intersection (tr_intersect_check to return 0 instead of -1)
- build test scene

03-16 (Tue)
[1st Eval] failed due to segmentation fault on incorrect rt file:
- correct exit with segmentation fault 
- --save must exit
- display if one H/W exceed, just change to computer display resolution
- go through evaluation sheet one by one
- build more scenes based on eval sheet.
